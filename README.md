# Aruco-Detector-and-Follower

My internship work on ROS Simulation of a Surveilliance Rover


Based on TurtleBot3 Waffle, the rover searches for and detects Aruco Marker Checkpoints and makes round trips between them.

The TurtleBot contains 6 Range sensors/Proximity sensors all around for obstacle detection and
An RGB camera in the front

Contains code for 

Detection of Markers and follow their direction with obstacle avoidance,

Edited URDF files, 

Gazebo World files and Aruco Markers (.dae format rectangular model files with marker texture added in Blender).
